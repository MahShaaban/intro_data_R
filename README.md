## Introduction to data analysis in R

### Description

This is a short course on data analysis in R. The goal is to get the 
participants familiar with R code and to appreciate it as a tool to handle
common experimental data. The materials are delivered in the form of 
transitional lectures and interactive exercises.

### Objectives

- To get familiar with R as a tool for data analysis
- To apply basic arithmetic and statistics in R
- To learn to handle experimental data in R (qPCR and images)

### Pre-requisite

- Introduction to R ([Data Camp Free Interactive Course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r))
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/), [RStudio Cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/login), and [Data Camp](https://app.datacamp.com/) accounts (Free)

### Format

Each module is delivered in three steps

- [`lectures/`](lectures/): slides discussing the main concepts
- [`practice/`](practice/): interactive exercises for practicing purposes
- [`homework/`](homework/): more exercises to test understanding
